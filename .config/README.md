# Arch Linux Dotfiles + Setup scripts

## For personal use tailored to my preference + easy to edit though, scripts are basic bash with original link to creator of script in comments, also include index to applications both FOSS, OSS, & PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE

# Works best on fresh arch install. 
## Start with yayinstall.sh
